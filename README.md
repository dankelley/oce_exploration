This repository is a sort of sandbox for exploration of ideas about the oce
R package. It is mainly for developers, so there is not much documentation
here.  Also, many of the R (and other) files may not even work, by virtue of
having been superseded, being dependent on data not stored here, or a variety
of other reasons.
