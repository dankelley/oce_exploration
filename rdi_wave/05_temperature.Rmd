The chunk type called 'FIRST LEADER' stores time and temperature (plus some other things).  I don't think other data types store temperature, but I could be wrong.  Anyway, below is a graph.

```{r fig.cap="Time variation of temperature."}
library(oce)
load("05.rda")
oce.plot.ts(firstLeader$time, firstLeader$temperature, type="l")
```
