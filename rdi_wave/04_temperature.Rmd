The chunk type called 'FIRST LEADER' stores time and temperature (plus some other things).  I don't think other data types store temperature, but I could be wrong.  Anyway, below is a graph.

```{r fig.cap="Time variation of temperature."}
library(oce)
l <- readLines(pipe("grep 'FIRST_LEADER' 04.out"))
time <- as.POSIXct(gsub(".*time=([^,]*).*", "\\1", l), tz="UTC")
temperature <- as.numeric(gsub(".*Temp=", "", l))
oce.plot.ts(time, temperature, type="l")
```
